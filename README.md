### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ted, and I'm a former Naval officer who is learning to code. Leading people (and numbers) I've done; getting code to fly right is new to me. But every day is another step in the right direction.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java - more to come with PhP, Spring, and some MySQL.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: my time in the Navy! I love to share sea-stories. I'm also getting pretty handy with Javascript - if you have a front-end piece to your project (or want to explore creating one) let's talk!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a character builder/dice roller for DnD 5E. Orcpub is dead - long live Orcpub! https://github.com/edwardmccormick/d-and-deasy It's in pretty rough shape right now - check the Readme to see where I'm currently at!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/ted-mccormick or my nickname.mylastname@gmail.com OR same @protonmail.com, for the security conscious.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his

- âš¡ Fun fact: I grew up in a town of 7,000 in the middle of nowhere Missouri, and when I was in 7th grade, my World History textbook had the mask of King Tut on the cover. When I was 25, and a Lieutenant (j.g.) in the Navy, during a port call in Cairo, Egypt, I got to stand in front of that same mask and look into its eyes. It was a pretty cool moment.
