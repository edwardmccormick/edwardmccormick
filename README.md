### Hi there 👋

My name is Ted, and I'm a former Naval officer who is learning to code. Leading people (and numbers) I've done; getting code to fly right is new to me. But every day is another step in the right direction.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the LAMP stack - although actually, I'm really learning the front-end of the stack right now (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with the back-end in the new year.

- 💬 Ask me about: my time in the Navy! I love to share sea-stories and I find that a lot of them are still powerful leadership lessons for me ten years later.

- 📫 How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/ted-mccormick or my nickname.mylastname@gmail.com OR same @protonmail.com, for the security conscious.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his

- ⚡ Fun fact: I grew up in a town of 7,000 in the middle of nowhere Missouri, and when I was in 7th grade, my World History textbook had the mask of King Tut on the cover. When I was 25, and a Lieutenant (j.g.) in the Navy, during a port call in Cairo, Egypt, I got to stand in front of that same mask and look into its eyes. It was a pretty cool moment.
